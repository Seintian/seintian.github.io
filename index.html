                    In this page I put all together the pages I made at school or by myself. <br>
                    When I made this I was at the beginning of HTML, so I tested a lot of things:
                    images, links, buttons, iframes, styles...
                    As you can see, in fact, it isn't such a nice page, but I made it as a main-page
                    where you can see other pages from. <br>
                    However, I'll put here the most relevant pages. 
                </p>

        <div class="content">
            <header>
                <h1 id="gothics">Gothic</h1>
            </header>

                        <div class="site-metas">
                            <h2 class="site-title" id="gothics-title">Gothics Page</h2>
                            <p class="site-desc" id="gothics-desc">A site with...</p>
                        </div>
                        <span class="lang-preview">(Italian)</span>

                </a>
                <p>
                    Here you can see an art-work I made on gothic and spanish-gothic. <br>
                    When I made it I was a little better in HTML, in fact I also used Javascript for some
                    things like the navbar that fixes up only when we scroll to bottom.
                    I used some third-part libraries to make many animations, too (<a

                    This is another homework, a science homework I've done on microplastics. <br>
                    Here I worked a lot on graphics, in fact I made this page as more responsive as I could:
                    I've made two styles, one for pc-viewers and one for mobile-viewers. <br>
                    Sadly, I didn't manage to make the site responsive also for tablets and other screens 
                    like that, it is the best I could do in those days, but I definitely learned a lot in 
                    terms of css.
