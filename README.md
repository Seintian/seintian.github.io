A page with school lessons, exercises and so on...

In `learning` you'll find some exercises I made to learn HTML, CSS and JS.
In all the other folders you'll find some works for school homework, for example.


# /gotico_arte/
Here you'll find a page I made for an art-homework, where I used some third-part libraries
to make cool effects such as animations.

# /micro_plastiche/
Here I did a homework for science, where I talk about an environment problem: 
the micro-plastic pollution.
