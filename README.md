A page with school lessons, exercises and so on...

# /learning/
In `learning` you'll find some exercises I made to learn HTML, CSS and JS.
In all the other folders you'll find some works for school homework, for example.


# /gotico_arte/
Here you'll find a page I made for an art-homework, where I used some third-part libraries
to make cool effects such as animations.

# /micro_plastiche/
Here I did a homework for science, where I talk about an environment problem: 
the micro-plastic pollution.

# /python_tutorial/
Here I made the best page I ever did, I think.
It was an IT homework and I did it as the best I could do. 
I used a lot of js, css and new things of HTML.
